	abstract = {This paper describes SentencePiece, a language-independent subword tokenizer and detokenizer designed for Neural-based text processing, including Neural Machine Translation. It provides open-source C++ and Python implementations for subword units. While existing subword segmentation tools assume that the input is pre-tokenized into word sequences, SentencePiece can train subword models directly from raw sentences, which allows us to make a purely end-to-end and language independent system. We perform a validation experiment of NMT on English-Japanese machine translation, and ﬁnd that it is possible to achieve comparable accuracy to direct subword training from raw sentences. We also compare the performance of subword training and segmentation with various conﬁgurations. SentencePiece is available under the Apache 2 license at https://github.com/google/ sentencepiece.},

These models are fine-tuned on a synthetic dataset, arabic-img2md, comprising 13.7k pairs of Arabic book pages and their Markdown representations. Key contributions include the Aranizer-PBE-86k tokenizer, designed for efficient tokenization, and the use of torch.bfloat16 precision with Flash Attention 2 for optimized training and inference. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performance, with arabic-large-nougat delivering the highest Markdown Structure Accuracy and the lowest Character Error Rate. Additionally, we release a large-scale dataset containing 1.1 billion Arabic tokens extracted from over 8,500 books using our best-performing model, providing a valuable resource for Arabic OCR research. All models, datasets, and code are open-sourced and available at https://github.com/MohamedAliRashad/arabic-nougat.},

In this paper we evaluate several stateof theart tokenization tools for German – including our own – with regard to theses criteria.

We study a set of nine typologically diverse languages with readily available pretrained monolingual models on a set of ﬁve diverse monolingual downstream tasks. We ﬁrst aim to establish, via fair and controlled comparisons, if a gap between the multilingual and the corresponding monolingual representation model of that language exists, and subsequently investigate the reason for any performance difference. To disentangle conﬂating factors, we train new monolingual models on the same data, with monolingually and multilingually trained tokenizers. We ﬁnd that while the pretraining data size is an important factor, a designated monolingual tokenizer plays an equally important role in the downstream performance. Our results show that languages that are adequately represented in the multilingual model’s vocabulary exhibit negligible performance decreases over their monolingual counterparts. We further ﬁnd that replacing the original multilingual tokenizer with the specialized monolingual tokenizer improves the downstream performance of the multilingual model for almost every task and language.},

@article{lin_not_nodate,
	title = {Not {All} {Tokens} {Are} {What} {You} {Need} for {Pretraining}},
	abstract = {Previous language model pre-training methods have uniformly applied a next-token prediction loss to all training tokens. Challenging this norm, we posit that “Not all tokens in a corpus are equally important for language model training”. Our initial analysis examines token-level training dynamics of language model, revealing distinct loss patterns for different tokens. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a new language model called RHO-1. Unlike traditional LMs that learn to predict every next token in a corpus, RHO-1 employs Selective Language Modeling (SLM), which selectively trains on useful tokens that aligned with the desired distribution. This approach involves scoring tokens using a reference model, and then training the language model with a focused loss on tokens with higher scores. When continual pretraining on 15B OpenWebMath corpus, RHO-1 yields an absolute improvement in few-shot accuracy of up to 30\% in 9 math tasks. After fine-tuning, RHO-1-1B and 7B achieved state-of-the-art results of 40.6\% and 51.8\% on MATH dataset, respectively — matching DeepSeekMath with only 3\% of the pretraining tokens. Furthermore, when continual pretraining on 80B general tokens, RHO-1 achieves 6.8\% average enhancement across 15 diverse tasks, increasing both data efficiency and performance of the language model pre-training.},

We find that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.},
